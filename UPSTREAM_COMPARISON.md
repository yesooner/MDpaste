| Path | Purpose |

| `MdPaste-portable-launcher.exe` | user-facing no-console launcher |
| `MDPASTE.cmd` | compatibility fallback launcher |
| `MdPaste-portable.cmd` | compatibility portable startup script |
| `portable-config.ps1` | rewrites portable paths on startup |
| `switch-startup.cmd` | Windows login startup helper |
| `build-release.ps1` | builds the Release ZIP |
| `build-installer.ps1` | builds the optional Inno Setup installer |
| `installer.iss` | Inno Setup project file |
| `tools/patch_release_exe.py` | applies the v0.1.8 executable compatibility patch |
| `tools/MdPastePortableLauncher.cs` | native no-console portable launcher source |
| `tools/build_portable_launcher.ps1` | builds the native portable launcher |
| `README.md` | user and maintenance documentation |
| `README.txt` | short user instructions included in ZIP |
| `RELEASE_NOTES.md` | GitHub Release notes |
| `NOTICE.md` | license notice |
| `SOURCE.md` | corresponding source information |
| `MODIFICATIONS.md` | detailed modification list |
| `GITHUB_UPLOAD_STEPS.md` | maintainer upload workflow |

## Limitations

The local portable package does not contain full readable Python source files outside `MdPaste.exe`. The v0.1.8 executable compatibility patch is documented and reproduced by `tools/patch_release_exe.py`.
