## What It Is MDPASTE

MDPASTE Portable is a Windows portable distribution of PasteMD. It converts copied Markdown into formatted content that can be pasted into Word, WPS, Office, and other supported applications.

Common use cases:

- Copy answers from AI chat tools.
- Preserve Markdown structures such as headings, lists, code blocks, tables, and formulas.
- Paste the converted result into documents with less manual cleanup.

Pandoc is bundled in this package, so users do not need to install Python, Pandoc, or other command-line tools separately.

## Quick Start

1. Open the GitHub Releases page.
2. Download `MDPASTE-portable-v0.1.2.zip`.
3. Extract it to any folder.
4. Double-click `MDPASTE.cmd`.
5. Copy Markdown content, then press the default hotkey `Ctrl+Alt+B` to convert/paste.

Do not start the app by double-clicking `MdPaste.exe`. Use `MDPASTE.cmd`, because it prepares the portable data folders and rewrites paths for the current computer.

## Portable Behavior

Every time `MDPASTE.cmd` starts the app, it rewrites runtime paths based on the current folder:

- `APPDATA` -> `portable-data\Roaming`
- `LOCALAPPDATA` -> `portable-data\Local`
- `pandoc_path` -> `_internal\pandoc\pandoc.exe` under the current folder
- `save_dir` -> `cache` under the current folder

This means the whole folder can be copied to another Windows computer. Start it again with `MDPASTE.cmd`; no manual path edits are required.

```

## Pandoc

PasteMD depends on Pandoc for document and rich-text conversion. The portable package includes Pandoc at:

```text
_internal\pandoc\pandoc.exe
```

Do not delete `_internal`. If Pandoc is missing, the launcher stops and asks the user to download the complete ZIP again.

## Local Data

These files are generated on the user's computer:

- Config: `portable-data\Roaming\PasteMD\config.json`
- Log: `portable-data\Roaming\PasteMD\pastemd.log`
- Cache: `cache`

They are local runtime data. They are not committed to Git and are not included in a clean release package.

## Changes from Upstream

Code and resource changes are documented in two files:

- `MODIFICATIONS.md`: explains which files were added or modified and what each script/resource file does.
- `UPSTREAM_COMPARISON.md`: lists files that differ from upstream PasteMD `v0.1.6.8`.

This repository commits the modified upstream resources identified from the local release package:

- locale files under `pastemd/i18n/locales`
- icon files under `assets/icons`

This repository also adds portable packaging files:

- `MDPASTE.cmd`
- `MdPaste-portable.cmd`
- `portable-config.ps1`
- `switch-startup.cmd`
- `build-release.ps1`
- documentation, license files, and source comparison files

If the distributed `MdPaste.exe` contains Python logic changes, the corresponding modified Python source used to build that binary must also be added.

## v0.1.2 Notes

`v0.1.2` is a compatibility bugfix release. Recommended versioning follows SemVer-style rules: increment patch for fixes, for example `0.1.1`; increment minor for new features, for example `0.2.0`; use `1.0.0` after a stable public interface is established.

This release fixes ChatGPT web fragment copy handling where code blocks could be treated as plain text and lose Markdown fences. Code blocks and inline code are also protected from LaTeX/formula rewrites, while normal body formula conversion remains enabled.

## Version Maintenance

When the release version changes, update these places together:

- Download filename in `README.md` and `i18n/README.en.md`.
- Version and asset name in `RELEASE_NOTES.md`.
- Upstream tag, commit, and source link in `SOURCE.md`.
- Default `$Version` in `build-release.ps1`.
- Git tag, for example `v0.1.2`.
- GitHub Release title, notes, and ZIP asset name.

Keeping these values aligned avoids mismatches between user instructions, release assets, and source notes.

## Release

Build the portable ZIP locally:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-release.ps1
```

Output:

```text
dist\MDPASTE-portable-v0.1.2.zip
```

Build the Windows installer after installing Inno Setup:

```powershell
winget install JRSoftware.InnoSetup
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-installer.ps1
```

Output:

```text
dist\MDPASTE-Setup-v0.1.2.exe
```

The complete runnable package is distributed as a GitHub Release asset. The Git repository stores launcher scripts, packaging scripts, documentation, licenses, source notes, and identified modified resources.

## Codex Notice

The portable launcher scripts, path configuration script, packaging script, README files, Release notes, NOTICE, SOURCE, MODIFICATIONS, and UPSTREAM_COMPARISON notes in this repository were drafted and organized with assistance from OpenAI Codex in conversation with the project maintainer.

The upstream PasteMD application itself is not authored by Codex.
